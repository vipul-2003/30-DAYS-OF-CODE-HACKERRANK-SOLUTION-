# 30 DAYS OF CODE HACKER RANK  


AS WE KNOW <font color ="red" > HACKERRANK</font> IS ONE OF THE BEST PLATFORM FOR THE BEGINNERS .

BUT SOMETIMES WHILE SOLVING THE PROBLEMS , WE GOT STUCK AND USUALLY WASTE A LOT OF OUR TIME TO  ON A SINGLE QUESTIONS .

TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, I HAVE PROVIDED THE SOLUTION OF THE ALL QUESTIONS , WHICH IS 100 PERCENT CORRECT AND WORKING , AND WERE WRITTEN BY ME **(VIPUL KUMAR SINGH )**

I HAVE A REQUEST NOT TO USE THEM IN BAD MANNER OR WE CAN SAY JUST COPY PASTE ....

THIS WILL MAKE YOU LOSER AND YOU NEVER BECOME AN EFFICIENT PROGRAMMER OR SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN FUTURE...

MAKE SURE TO USE THIS CODE ONLY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK NEED TO BE DONE ...


THANKS...
